am going to change it
1. git clone repname
2. edit files or add files (git add finename or git add .)
3. then do git commit
4. git push
5. will it go into GIT commit???

use "git diff" to see teh difference between the Staging area and working dirctory.
Change the files, do "git add" to add to stage. Then change teh files again before commit and see them using "git diff"
